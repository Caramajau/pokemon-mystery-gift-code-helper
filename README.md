## Pokémon Mystery Gift Code Helper

### What is it?
If you've ever wanted to start an application, write the abbreviation for a Pokémon game, and see the available mystery gift codes, then this application is for you!

### Why does it exist?
Now [that](#what-is-it) might sound oddly specific and niche, but it serves a purpose for anyone who wants to keep track of their mystery gift codes easily. Much time can be spent searching and then looking for articles with codes, but that is no more with this application. Here, one article has been chosen for each game (see [included games below](#current-games-included)) based on their relevance and the availability of codes to hopefully provide the *best* article for each game.

### Installation
1. Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/Caramajau/pokemon-mystery-gift-code-helper/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.
3. (optional) Create a shortcut to the application or pin it to start for easier access.

### Instructions
After installing the application, simply run `PokemonMysteryGiftCodeHelper.exe` and enter the abbreviation for the Pokémon game you want to get codes for.

### Current games included

- sv (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)
